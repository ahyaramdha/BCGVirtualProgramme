topic: customer churn

**task 1:**
a. Gain a better understanding of the problem our client is facing and translate the business problem into a data science
one. 
b. Understand what is going on with the client and to think about how you would approach this problem and test the specific hypothesis.

**Task 2:**
a. Get some initial insights on the client's business in the form of key vlues and visualization of the data.
b. The AD would like you to investigate whether price sensitivity is the most influential factor for a customer churning, and if not, 
to what extent does price sensitivity influence churn.

**Task 3:** 
a. Brainstorm and create features that could be fed into the churn model. This feature is the difference between off-peak prices in
December and January of the preceding year. Use your engineered features to uncover insight from the data by training a model to predict
churn probabilities.
1. Balance complexity with overall preformance and reliability
2. Focus on refining a single model
3. Use a random forest
4. Evaluate the model 
5. Measure against assessment criteria that makes sense
b. Estelle reviewed your work with the AD and Estelle has come up with an  idea to enrich the dataset when trying to predict churn:
“I think that the difference between off-peak prices in December and January the preceding year could be a significant feature when
predicting churn”
As the Data Scientist on the team, you need to investigate this question. So, in this task you’ll be responsible for completing feature
eingeering for the dataset.

**Task 4:**
a. Build a predictive model for churn using a random forest technique and Write an executive summary with your findings.
